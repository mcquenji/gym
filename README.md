# About

A PWA for tracking and comparing my and my friend's gym progress.

_No unit tests because it's just a personal project for me and my friends <sub>(and I'm lazy<sup>TM</sup>)</sub>._

# Development

1. Start Firebase emulators

   ```bash
   firebase emulators:start
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```bash
   flutter run -d [chrome|firefox]
   ```

3. Happy coding!
